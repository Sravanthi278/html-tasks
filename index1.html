<p>. Acquisition management module
Libraries need to keep refreshing their resources but the full acquisition cycle is manually intensive. Keeping track of all the different cogs involved is easier with Acquisition Management Module. IT starts with the selection of resources which is done using pre-order bibliographic searching of the library catalog to avoid duplication and then

The order is placed
The goods are received
Quality checked,
Invoices processed
Payment is made to vendors
Records of the acquisitions are maintained
Automatic allocation of book IDs to new acquisitions
2. Catalog management module
A very important feature is catalog management, the method by which metadata is created representing the knowledge resources of your library such as books, articles, documents, audio clips, maps, digital content.  The software will digitally keep track of what is available in the library and catalog the content by title, subject, author and date of publishing.

The system uses rack numbers and location identifiers to catalog library resources so that students and staff know exactly which shelf of which rack the book or knowledge resource they are looking for can be retrieved from.

3. User management module
A detailed database of users with their name, ID, login and password is created. This helps in keeping track of the memberâ€™s library usage. Also, a multi-user environment ensures that many users can use the software without speed or access issues.

4. Circulation management module
The library management system is integrated with barcodes, smart cards and /or RFID to track the movement of books as well as for stock verification. RFID or radio frequency identification uses automatic identification and data capture (AIDC)  technology. Here digital data encoded in RFID tags or smart labels are captured using radio waves and then entered directly into computer systems.  RFID tag data can be read outside the line of sight of the electronic reader.  However, barcodes must be aligned with an optical scanner.

Smart cards differ from RFID tags in that they incorporate both RFID and barcode technologies.  Students also have their ID and library cards enabled with tag or barcode integration with the library management system of your school ERP.  The downside of RFID technology which is newer than barcode integration is that  RFID cards, tags, and readers are more expensive.

Barcode scanning is a visual depiction of the unique item number assigned to each resource which can be read electronically by a scanner. Coding is done on the basis of title, author, topic and date of publishing. Each barcode is linked to a corresponding entry in a computer database which is automatically updated when books are scanned at the time of issue or return.

The search function should enable students to go to the library section on the school or college website and easily search for their topic. The librarian and students should be able to search by names of authors, subjects or even publishers or can define the search field with search filters based on need. The search result will inform the user whether the resource is available and where to find it. In case the book is checked out, it can also send notifications when a particular book is available.

5. Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC)
Online Public Access Catalog for Library Management
The advantage of an online public access catalog system has been highlighted during remote learning because of the pandemic.  Students can search for books, e-resources and journals from wherever they are and need not be confined to the library premises. Students will need to enter their login credentials and password via the web to access the catalog. The search results could offer students direct electronic access to the resources or give their physical location in the library.
6. Fee management module
The software keeps track of membership fees and manages individual student accounts. In case of unreturned, lost or damaged books, the software throws up the fine due from the student by automatically counting days from the due date. Next comes intimating the student of the fine and ensuring that until the payment is made, there are restrictions on the student using the libraryâ€™s resources.</p>
